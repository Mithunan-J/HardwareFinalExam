I made a controller for the blinky ghost (the one that chases pac man).
The push buttons are used to change Blinky's horizontal or vertical movement.
Pressing the left push button will change the vertical movement.
- If Blinky is moving horizontally he will begin moving vertically.
- If Blinky is already moving vertically he will change direction.
Pressing the right push button will change the horizontal movemnt.
- If Blinky is moving vertically he will begin moving horizontally.
- If Blinky is already moving horizontally he will change direction.

The block in the middle of the controller is a photo resistor.
When players cover the photoresistor with their finger, Blinky will temporarily turn invisible. This can be a useful gameplay feature as it will help the player avoid being eaten by pac man.

The controller is shaped like Blinky in order to better suit his likeness.
I  round the edges of the controller so that it is comfortable to hold.
There is extra space around the controller for player to rest their fingers.

Inputs = 2 push buttons
Actuator = 1 led
Sensor = Photoresistor
